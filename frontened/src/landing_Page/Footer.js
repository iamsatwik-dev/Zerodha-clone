              Attention investors: 1) Stock brokers can accept securities as
              margins from clients only by way of pledge in the depository
              system w.e.f September 01, 2020. 2) Update your e-mail and phone
              number with your stock broker / depository participant and receive
              OTP directly from depository on your e-mail and/or mobile number
              to create pledge. 3) Check your securities / MF / bonds in the
              consolidated account statement issued by NSDL/CDSL every month

              information of your transactions directly from Exchange on your
              mobile/email at the end of the day. Issued in the interest of
              investors. KYC is one time exercise while dealing in securities
              markets - once KYC is done through a SEBI registered intermediary
              (broker, DP, Mutual Fund etc.), you need not undergo the same
              process again when you approach another intermediary." Dear
              Investor, if you are subscribing to an IPO, there is no need to
              issue a cheque. Please write the Bank account number and sign the
              IPO application form to authorize your bank to make payment in
              case of allotment. In case of non allotment the funds will remain
              in your bank account. As a business we don't give stock tips, and
              have not authorized anyone to trade on behalf of others. If you
              find anyone claiming to be part of Zerodha and offering such
              services, please{" "}
